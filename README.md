# CoreUI Web3 React Admin Template
This project is a web3 version of the CoreUI React admin template. It is a fork of the CoreUI admin template built with React.

Overview
We have extended the functionality of the original CoreUI template by adding web3 capabilities using the following libraries:

- RainBowKit - RainbowKit is a React library that makes it easy to add wallet connection to your dapp. It's intuitive, responsive and customizable.
- Axios - Axios is a simple promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Axios provides a simple to use library in a small package with a very extensible interface.
- Redux - For state management.
- Redux Saga - For managing side effects, such as fetching blockchain data.

The CoreUI template already utilizes React and Bootstrap to provide a robust admin template with a wide range of UI components.
