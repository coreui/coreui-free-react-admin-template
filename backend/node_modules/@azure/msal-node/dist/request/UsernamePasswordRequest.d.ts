 * - claims                 - A stringified claims request which will be added to all /authorize and /token calls. When included on a silent request, cache lookup will be skipped and token will be refreshed.
 * - authority              - Url of the authority which the application acquires tokens from.
 * - correlationId          - Unique GUID set per request to trace a request end-to-end for telemetry purposes.
 * - username               - username of the client
 * - password               - credentials
