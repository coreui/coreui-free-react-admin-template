# 2.0.0

- Export AbortController class. This is a non-breaking change for JavaScript users and almost surely a non-breaking change for TypeScript users but we are doing a major version bump to be safe.

# 1.2.0

- Remove dependency on lib.dom for types that was conflicting with NodeJS types

# 1.1.0

- Add proper EventTarget support to signal and `signal.onabort`

# 1.0.4

- Initial Stable Release
