Tedious is a pure-Javascript implementation of the [TDS protocol](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd304523.aspx),
which is used to interact with instances of Microsoft's SQL Server. It is intended to be a fairly slim implementation of the protocol, with not too much additional functionality.

**NOTE: New columns are nullable by default as of version 1.11.0**

Previous behavior can be restored using `config.options.enableAnsiNullDefault = false`. See [pull request 230](https://github.com/tediousjs/tedious/pull/230).

**NOTE: Default login behavior has changed slightly as of version 1.2**

See the [changelog](https://github.com/tediousjs/tedious/releases) for version history.
